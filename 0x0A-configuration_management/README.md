# Configuration management

In this project, I started working with Puppet as a configuration management
tool. I practiced writing Puppet manifest files to create a file, install a
package, and execute a command.

    dpkg -i puppet7-release-focal.deb && \
    apt-get update && \
    apt-get install puppet-agent puppet-lint -y

# confirming installation
puppet -V
puppet-lint -v

# If you get an error saying puppet command not found, source the path
source /etc/profile.d/puppet-agent.sh
